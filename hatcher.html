                    I will not enter the cave with muddy or soiled clothes, boots, or other gear as a preventative measure against the human transportation of the fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans (the cause of White-nose Syndrome) or other pathogens that may have negative impacts on the fauna of the cave. Equipment and clothing known to have been used in other cave regions will be properly decontaminated using accepted methods (see the NSS or USFWS websites) prior to entering Hatcher Pit. Likewise, I will properly clean and decontaminate all my equipment, clothing, and boots AFTER visiting this cave.

                <div class="space-y-4 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed print-black">
                    <p>I acknowledge that Hatcher Pit is a completely "wild" cave (non-commercial cave), and no improvements have been made or are desirable. I understand that a visit to a wild cave involves certain risks including but not limited to those listed on this Release and Waiver Agreement. I desire to visit Hatcher Pit and will do so completely at my own risk.</p>

                    <p>I acknowledge that Hatcher Pit is a vertical cave entrance and that a very real danger of becoming lost, injured, or trapped exists within the cave system.</p>

                    <p>I acknowledge the cave entrance is a vertical pit with associated inherent risks and dangers. I acknowledge that I am certified and well trained in vertical caving and own my own gear and will be using my own gear. I will not be sharing gear with others.</p>

                    <p>I acknowledge that I will be using existing manmade or natural rigging points and/or anchors for attaching my rope(s) to and these could break or dislodge accidentally or by unknown means. I will use a backup rig point for all anchors and rigging points.</p>

                    <p>I acknowledge that regions of Hatcher Pit may be physically demanding and may require exposure to cold water with the associated risks.</p>

                    <p>I acknowledge that any or all of the cave passage could and is known to flood partially and/or completely, and that it is impossible to predict the time lag between rainfall and flood-flow in the cave. I understand that the water in Hatcher Pit may be polluted and may be dangerous to my health.</p>

                    <p>I acknowledge that steep, slippery mud banks, loose piles of rock, unstable formations, and rock falls occur in various locations in the cave and pose hazards known or unknown, such as, but not limited to, slipping, falling, and being hit or crushed.</p>

                    <p>I acknowledge that there may be higher levels of radioactivity in a limestone cave as compared to the surface of the earth for completely natural reasons and that the effect of this radiation on a cave explorer is unknown; but that smoking increases the amount of this radiation absorbed by the body. I will not smoke in the cave.</p>

                    <p>I acknowledge that access to Hatcher Pit may be controlled by a locked gate or other means and that access requirements may change at any time. I understand that, due to a mechanical malfunction of any gate or lock, that I may be unable to get out of the cave. I will prepare for this eventuality by telling someone of my plans and carrying adequate food and clothing.</p>

                    <p>I acknowledge that any gate or entrance structure is heavy and combined with the vertical entrance could result in injury if opened, dropped, closed, or misused while someone is entering, exiting, climbing, or rappelling the entrance drop. I will not use any gate or structure as a hand hold or for any other means while using this entrance.</p>

                    <p>I acknowledge that I have the proper equipment to go caving, to include but not limited to, three sources of lights, helmet, gloves, and boots, in addition to the necessary vertical cave equipment. I am well versed and trained in caving first aid, cave rescue, and caving self-rescue.</p>

                    <p>I will not make any changes to the cave including digging or modifying cave passages.</p>

                    <p>I will not use any drugs, alcohol, or any intoxicating substances in the cave or on the adjacent property.</p>

                    <p>I am stating that I am in good health and I am not taking any prescribed medicine at the present time and do not know of any health reasons that should keep me from entering and exploring this cave. I am 18 years of age or older. (No one under the age of 18 is allowed to enter this cave.)</p>

                    <p>I understand that it is a criminal act to knowingly harm any cave fauna or animal, formation, or endangered species.</p>

                    <p>I will cave with a minimum of four persons while on a Hatcher Pit trip. I understand that I have to have three other people on this trip, and they need to sign waivers.</p>

                    <p>I acknowledge that no compensation has been given to the trip leader or organizer of this trip (sharing transportation costs is acceptable).</p>
